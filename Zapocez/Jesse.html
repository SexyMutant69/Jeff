        <h2><br>Where have all the debates stemmed from?</h2>
        <p>Jesse Laico is a person shrouded in mystery. We don't know where, when or how he was born... Our mere human brains wouldn't probably even be able
            to comprehend these fact - That's why it's better they stay an enigma. What we can debate about, however, is Jesse's elite status: The only thing 
            we could be able to empirically prove or at least try to support with evidence. That's why there are countless discussion about the topic of
            Jesse's elite status... On this website, I will try to gather the most convincing points and arguments, while trying to stay as impartial as possible.         
        </p>
    
        <p><br>I've put together a chart tracking Jesse's proggresion over the years. With this you can get the basic picture of Jesse's status.
        However, there are only two official records regarding Jesse and his gains. That's why this table is shorter than we'd hope to be... Enjoy though!</p>
